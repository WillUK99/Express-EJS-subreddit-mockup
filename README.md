# Express-EJS-subreddit-mockup
A light hearted project to help develop my Express and EJS skills to a mockup of a couple subreddits.


## Technologies.
-HTML -JS -Node.JS -Express -EJS -Bootstrap 

### About.
Using Express to start a local server and route templates from external files to render a mockup of a  handful of subreddits. The two templates are comprised of EJS files which can be found within '/views'. The data from these are taken from the data.json file and if it matches that of the pattern from the URL then the data is destructured and plugged into the relevant EJS files. Bootstrap is also implemented into this project.
